# A JARM fork with multithreading  
  
Please read the initial [JARM blog post](https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a) for more information.

The original GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/salesforce/jarm)

This fork was created for adding multithreading to the original project and speed up the processing massive lists of domains or IP addresses.
